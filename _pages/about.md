I am an extreme weather enthusiast. I completed my B.E Mechanical at the University of Kashmir in 2018 and M. Tech at Savitribai Phule Pune University jointly with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, in 2021. I did my dissertation at IITM Pune on Radar-based QPE under the advisor Dr. M.C.R. Kalapureddy. I am currently working towards my Ph.D. degree at Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA, with Dr. Dan Dawson.
